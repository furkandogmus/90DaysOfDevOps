What is devops?

DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.


Automation: Automation is the application of technology, programs, robotics or processes to achieve outcomes with minimal human input.

Scaling: A system is considered scalable when it doesn’t need to be redesigned to maintain effective performance during or after a steep increase in workload. The workload could refer to simultaneous users, storage capacity, the maximum number of transactions handled, or anything else that pushes the system past its original capacity.

There are two scaling operations: 
1- Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)
2- Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)

Infrastructure: IT infrastructure is made up of the usual hardware and software components: facilities, data centers, servers, networking hardware desktop computers and enterprise application software solutions.

Why Devops is Important?

While a DevOps transformation requires an overhaul of business structures and processes, it’s well worth the effort. In our 2020 DevOps Trends survey, 99 percent of respondents said that DevOps had a positive impact on their organization. 

Another DevOps study, DORA’s State of DevOps 2019, found that elite practitioners release 208 times more frequently and 106 times faster than low-performing teams. And it’s not just speed to market, DevOps yields improved quality, with elite teams boasting a change failure rate seven times lower compared to low-performing teams.
