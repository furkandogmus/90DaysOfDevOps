Basic Linux Commands:

1- pwd: current directory

2- ls: list the items on the current directory
2.1 ls -alh: list all files and directory with extra information as permissions and size of the file.

3- mkdir: create directory
3.1 mkdir -p 1/2/3/4: recursive folder creation (I learnt it today. This is an interesting info. I like it :) )
3.2 mkdir .folder: hidden folder create
3.3 mkdir A B C D: create all directories in the directory.

4. cd: change the current directory
4.1 cd ~ : go to the home directory
